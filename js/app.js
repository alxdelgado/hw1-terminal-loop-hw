// Homework Terminal Loop // 

// 1. String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions"
  'this is string interpolation'
  // "Concatenation allows you to combine to strings together."
  const newString = 'stringA' + 'stringB'

// 2. DRY code is to reduce repitition of code. We should pay attention to it because we can reduce the amount of code we write by using certain loops or other methods to do more than one task.
  // You can use a for loop to write DRY code as an example. 

// SECTION 2 // 
// 1. a < b; 
// 2. c > d; 
// 3. 'name' === 'name'; 
// 4. a < b < c;
// 5. a__a__d; 
// 6. e = 'kevin'; 
// 7. 48 = '48'; 


// SECTION 3 // 
// 1. This is an infinite loop, there is no value set to end the loop. 
// 2. No, because runProgram is set = false. 
// 3. The code gave me the predicted response of 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA', as long as 'i' is < 20 the while loop will continue to pront the letters 'A'.
